# Bop-it-Pull-it-Game
Its the remake of the physical Bop-it Pull-it Push-it and Flick-it game but using computer vision.

The actual game consists of a handheld device with various input methods, typically including buttons, switches, and pull handles. The objective is to respond quickly to verbal commands issued by the device, which instruct players to perform different actions such as "bop it," "twist it," or "pull it."

We have removed the handheld part and replaced it with gestures which could be used to represent the same actions as one would do in the handheld device. As the game progresses, the verbal commands get a bit faster and hence requiring the player to make the gestures quickly.
